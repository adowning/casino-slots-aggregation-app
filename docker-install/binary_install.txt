Install static binaries
 tar xzvf /path/to/<FILE>.tar.gz

Optional: Move the binaries to a directory on your executable path, such as /usr/bin/. If you skip this step, you must provide the path to the executable when you invoke docker or dockerd commands.

 sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/

Start the Docker daemon:

 sudo dockerd &

If you need to start the daemon with additional options, modify the above command accordingly or create and edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json to add the custom configuration options.

Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

 sudo docker run hello-world

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.
